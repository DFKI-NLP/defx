" The graph in [ link ] shows the absorption spectra for chlorophyll a , chlorophyll b , and a type of carotenoid pigment called β - carotene ( which absorbs blue and green light ) ."	"1"
" 308 . Both photosystems have the same basic structure ; a number of antenna proteins to which the chlorophyll molecules are bound surround the reaction center where the photochemistry takes place ."	"0"
" Each photosystem is serviced by the light - harvesting complex , which passes energy from sunlight to the reaction center ; it consists of multiple antenna proteins that contain a mixture of 300–400 chlorophyll a and b molecules as well as other pigments like carotenoids ."	"1"
" 311 . The reaction center contains a pair of chlorophyll a molecules with a special property ."	"0"
